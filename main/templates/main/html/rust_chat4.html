            A raid in Rust is the climax of the entire wipe. Hours of farming, preparation, and tension
            culminate in a few minutes of chaos. It doesn’t matter if it’s successful or not — the emotions
            linger for a long time.

            PvP in Rust is always unfair. Someone shoots from the roof, someone from an ambush, 
            someone with numerical advantage. But it’s this unfairness that makes every fair victory even sweeter.

            The biggest dramas in Rust are born during raids. All plans can collapse in a second: 
            an unexpected enemy, a fatal move, or a mistake in team coordination. And it’s this chaos 
            that pushes players to constantly improve.

            PvP in Rust isn’t about fairness — it’s about opportunity. Those who can analyze the situation 
            gain an advantage. Even if you are outnumbered, proper positioning and map knowledge 
            can turn the fight in your favor.
