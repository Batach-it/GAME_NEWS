            Loot in Rust is not just resources, but your time. Every crate, every safe, carries risk and opportunity. 
            Sometimes a single successful run can change the entire wipe.

            A good base is not the one that’s hard to raid, but the one people don’t want to raid. Thoughtful design,
            hidden location, and minimal noise often work better than thick walls.

            Every loot in Rust is a small victory. Even a few stones or metal can change your plans for the day. 
            The value of resources isn’t just in quantity, but in the effort spent acquiring them.

            A thoughtful base is more than walls and doors. It’s psychology, strategy, and invisible defense. 
            Those who know how to hide and stay unnoticed often gain more advantages than those who built 
            the strongest fort.
