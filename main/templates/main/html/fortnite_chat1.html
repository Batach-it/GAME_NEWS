            Each new Fortnite season is a true celebration for players. New maps, mechanics, weapons, 
            and characters change the entire game dynamics. Those accustomed to old tactics must adapt 
            and invent new strategies to survive in the evolving world. Updates often bring unexpected 
            changes that can dramatically affect matchmaking, loot placement, and gameplay style.

            Fortnite seasons are not just about cosmetics and new legends. They create a new world story, 
            introduce special events, and change the rules of interacting with the map. Players must constantly 
            analyze new mechanics, find advantageous positions, and learn to use weapons effectively. 
            Those who fail to adapt quickly fall behind.
