                CS2: A Reimagining of the Entire Series

        <div class="article-content">
            CS2 is not just a new version of Counter-Strike, but an attempt to rethink the entire series.
            If you think about it, Valve has, for the first time in many years, truly changed the foundation
            of the game: the engine, physics, smokes, and tickrate. That is exactly why everything feels a bit chaotic right now.

            <br><br>

            There is a theory that Valve is deliberately enduring the current wave of criticism so that in a year
            or two they can deliver a highly polished product. Another theory suggests that the company is simply
            testing the limits of the community’s patience, gradually shaping the game according to its own vision
            rather than the players’ wishes.

            <br><br>

            The main question is whether CS2 will become a game “for everyone,” or if it will ultimately move toward
            a more hardcore, slower, and more tactical style of gameplay. The future of the entire scene depends on this.

                CS2: A Game That Forces You to Think

            CS2 is often criticized for not delivering instant gratification like it did in the past.
            But if you look deeper, it becomes clear that the game forces players to think.
            It punishes rushing, mindless peeks, and the habit of relying solely on reaction time.

            <br><br>

            There is a strong sense that Valve is trying to make Counter-Strike a more “chess-like” game,
            where decisions matter more than mechanical skill.
            This may push away part of the audience, but at the same time attract those who seek depth
            and long-term mastery.

            <br><br>

            Perhaps in a few years, we will look back at today’s CS2 as a difficult,
            yet necessary stage in the game’s evolution.
