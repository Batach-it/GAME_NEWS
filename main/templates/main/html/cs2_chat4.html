            CS2 has shown that the status of “top team” no longer guarantees stability.
            Even the strongest rosters can fail due to small mistakes or poor adaptation to new conditions.

            <br><br>

            The pro scene is now in a unique state: old leaders are still holding on,
            but new contenders are already breathing down their necks.
            This makes matches unpredictable and far more exciting for viewers.

            <br><br>

            Perhaps we are witnessing the birth of a new era in CS, where no single team dominates,
            and competition becomes fiercer than ever.

            The transition to CS2 has exposed the weak points of many top teams.
            Rosters that dominated CS:GO for years suddenly started to look uncertain.
            Their well-practiced strategies stopped working, and individual skill doesn’t always save them.

            <br><br>

            Meanwhile, young and lesser-known teams got a chance to shine.
            They adapt faster, are less tied to old routines, and embrace new game mechanics more easily.

            <br><br>

            CS2 may well become the reboot point for the entire esports scene,
            where authority and past achievements no longer guarantee victories.
