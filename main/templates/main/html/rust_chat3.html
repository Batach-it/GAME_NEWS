            Rust is a game about people — about betrayal, trust, greed, and survival. There are no moral rules
            except those you set yourself. Some help newcomers, while others raid them on the very first day.

            Toxicity in Rust is not a bug, but part of the atmosphere. It shapes player character and makes
            every victory meaningful. Without risk, loss, and pain, this game wouldn’t be so memorable.

            Rust makes you think not only about the game but also about human behavior. Trust, betrayal, moral
            dilemmas — all of this happens daily. Sometimes it’s easier to lose your base and stay alive than
            to save materials at any cost.

            Every player in Rust creates their own survival story. Some form alliances, others betray. 
            And even when things don’t go as planned, the experience stays forever. This makes Rust more 
            than just a game — it’s a social experiment.
