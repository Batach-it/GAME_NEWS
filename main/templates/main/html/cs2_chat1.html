                CS2 Updates Highlight the Game’s Biggest Issue

        <div class="article-content">
            Recent CS2 updates have once again highlighted the game’s main problem — uncertainty.
            With each patch, Valve seems to take a step forward, but at the same time new questions appear.
            Some players experience improved FPS, others complain about freezes, some feel changes in gunplay,
            while others notice no difference at all.

            <br><br>

            What frustrates players the most is not even the bugs themselves, but the lack of clear communication.
            Players often don’t understand whether an issue is temporary or “working as intended”.
            Because of this, tension in the community continues to grow.

            <br><br>

            The real question is how much more time CS2 needs to become a stable and predictable game,
            rather than a lottery after every update.

                CS2 as a Constant Experiment
            </h1>

        <div class="article-content">
            With every new patch, it becomes increasingly clear that CS2 is in a state of constant experimentation.
            Valve seems to be testing different solutions directly on a live audience, not always warning players
            about the consequences. One update may improve gunplay, while another can break the feeling of movement
            or the round economy.

            <br><br>

            The problem is that for the average player, this creates a sense of instability.
            You get used to a certain playstyle, find comfortable settings, and after an update,
            everything has to be readjusted again. This is exhausting, especially for those who play regularly.

            <br><br>

            On the other hand, this very approach allows the game to evolve.
            The only question is whether the community will have enough patience to wait for the moment
            when CS2 finally “gets on track.”
